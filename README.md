After the installation, I opened the IPFS Desktop application.  
The IPFS node connected automatically, and the status showed as **Online**.

## File Upload

To upload a file:

1. I navigated to the **Files** section within IPFS Desktop.
2. Then, I clicked on the **Import** button.
3. I uploaded a few sample files â€“ including a **SQL Notes**.

Once uploaded, IPFS automatically generated a unique **CID (Content Identifier)** for each file.
